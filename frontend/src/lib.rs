//! # NIVC Folding for Noir Circuits
//!
//! This crate provides an frontend implementation to use Non-uniform Incrementally Verifiable
//! Computation (NIVC) folding for Noir circuits. NIVC allows for incremental verification of
//! computations across different circuit types, enabling complex proof systems that can switch
//! between different circuit implementations during execution.
//!
//! ## Key Components
//!
//! - **Noir Programs**: Representation and handling of Noir language programs
//! - **Switchboard**: Manages the flow between different circuit implementations
//! - **Setup**: Handles parameter generation and initialization for the proof system
//! - **Proof Generation**: Creation and verification of folding proofs
//!
//! ## Cryptographic Backends
//!
//! The crate uses several cryptographic backends:
//! - Primary curve: bn254 (also known as BN256)
//! - Secondary curve: Grumpkin
//! - Proof systems: ``SuperNova``, Spartan R1CS SNARKs
//!
//! ## Memory Models
//!
//! The crate supports two memory models:
//! - **ROM (Read-Only Memory)**: All computation steps are known in advance
//! - **RAM (Random Access Memory)**: Computation steps are determined dynamically
//!
//! ## Example Usage
//!
//! The crate provides demo implementations accessible via the `demo` module when
//! built with the `demo` feature.
